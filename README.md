This reop contains a little code (in some languages) for the calculation of the hebrew calendar i made for **learning purposes**. The code is not optimized and may contain errors. 

The code is based on the book _Calendrical Calculations_ by Edward M. Reingold and Nachum Dershowitz. 

For any hebrew year the code can calculate the following:
- the cycles and remainder of a given year in the 19-year cycle.
- the number of months since the beginning of the cycle.
- the number of months since the Molad Baharad (2 days, 5 hours, and 204 parts)
- the Molad Tishri for the given year
- the weekday of Rosh Hashanah for the given year
- the weekday of the first day of Pesach for the given year
- the type of the year for a given year (חסרה, מלאה, שלמה)
- the number of days in the year
